# Layer0

This project is a 3 part collection inspired by the emerging 3 tier architecture developing on top of blockchain technology (Store of Value, DeFi, dApps).

# "Store of value" - Meet The Cryptoes

1st  layer is "Store of value". This role is being filled currently by Bitcoin and the new comer to the space... NFTs. "Meet The Cryptoes" is meant to be an artistic store of value in that it's sole focus is on creating pieces of Art/Value independent on any "utilization" dimension. This is analogous to Gold in that people like it for being "shiny" and would like Gold around them regardless of whether they were able to transact with it or not (being able to exchange for other things of value becomes an added plus but NOT essential for a certain base level of individual value).  MTC is focused on capturing ideas, humor, and visuals into a discrete visual package for people to simply enjoy to look at and think about. This simple store of value is the basis for a building block or "Primitive" of value that can be integrated into other higher order structures/dynamics compositionally forming the basis for a larger emergent ecosystem.

# "DeFi" - NFT Geronimos

The next stratum of the decentralized onion is the "Decentralized Finance" a.k.a. "DeFi" or "Liquid layer". This layer is being dominated by "Ethereum" and the role of blockchain "Smart Contracts". DeFi is a layer on top of, not along side, "Store of value" and provides the liquidity layer. This layer can be thought of as a "Glue" layer that will interface with the solid multi-polar layer underneath ("Store of value") with the "Wavey/Cloudy" service/application (dApps) layer up above that will abstract away the coupling between the value(s) and the service(s) . The dApps will provide one of the main high level ways an individual will be interfacing with this new ecosystem.

DeFi is about liquidity/money and "NFT Geronimos" is about the journey of random ordinary people (i.e. have day jobs) jumping into the pool with booth feet.

# "dApps" - dArtists

This is the 3rd layer and outermost gateway into the dEconomy. "Meet The Cryptoes" is at it's heart about building a community revolving around shared interests, values, and services. The community Discord server "Layer0" (https://discord.gg/6c7hV4XR26) is open for all to join. People who own any Kegon NFT (Meet The Cryptoes, NFT Geronimo, dArtist, etc...) will be able to attain the role of "NFT Geronimo" and then "dArtist". NFT Geronimos will be able to take pictures to create "scenes" with their NFT (Kegon or other) in the background and give their scene a title similar to "Meet The Cryptos" or "NFT Geronimos" work. The community will be able to vote on a regular basis for which NFT Geronimo piece will be turned into a Kegon and minted in the "NFT Geronimo" collection. They artist will be given first chance to buy the NFT if they want @ .0001 ETH + minting cost regardless of current market value so if the value of these pieces go up then the financial insentive for participation increases along with the value of everyone else's (early participants) existing NFTs. This is designed to build community engagement. The focus is to empower people involved in the project to be involved in not only the creation but very importantly the monetization (Uber for Artists). Once an artist has a piece added to the OpenSource code repo and launched on OpenSea.io they will be able to included in the dArtist collection for the world to see.

It is clear to me that for decentralized technology to have any hope of facilitating greater freedom and empowerment for those involved its primary source of value is the community of like minded individuals required to sustain it. People like to talk about "Layer1" as foundation but this project was inspired by the belief that the community is foundational, not the technology, and that is why the community is called "Layer0".   

The long term goal is to have the OpenSource (outside of copyright) codebase hosted on Github become a community controlled and governed project handing off decision making to a DAO that would sustain the project long term and Kegon will bow out with smiles. 

Final goal will be when dArtists want to make their own art without being launched into the Layer0 ecosystem. For those dArtists who go on to create their own separate independent work but still want to carry over the value curated in the "Layer0" community comes the "Layer0 dArtist Certification" collection which will be an NFT collection designed for each individual dArtist with their Artist name and sold exclusively to them (without royalties). They can then use it as a marketing tool to help stand out from other creators and can create value if the Layer0 community/brand grows in the NFT space.

Much love to all and appreciate any/all participation with this project. Thank you.

Kegon
